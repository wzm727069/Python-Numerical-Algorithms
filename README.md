# COMP361 - Numerical Methods F2019


### test1 - Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations

This assignment must be submitted individually. You are encouraged to 
discuss and exchange solutions during the tutorial sessions or on 
Slack, but you are *not allowed* to share code electronically. 
Plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration and other offences under 
Concordia's [Academic Code of Conduct](http://www.concordia.ca/students/academic-integrity/offences.html) will be firmly handled. 

### Test environment and live feedback.

Your code will be tested with Python 3.5 in a Ubuntu environment 
provided by Travis CI. It is your responsibility to ensure that the 
tests will pass in this environment. The following resources will help 
you.

Python 3.5 is available in the computer labs and can be loaded using 
`module load python/3.5.1`. You can check the version of Python that 
you are using by running `python --version`. Computer labs can easily be
accessed remotely, using `ssh`.

It is strongly suggested that you run the disclosed tests before 
submitting your assignment, using `pytest` as explained previously. 

Live feedback on your assignment is provided through Travis CI 
[here](https://travis-ci.com/tgteacher). You will have to sign-in using 
your GitHub account to see your assignment repository. **Your grade will be determined 
from the result of the
tests executed in Travis CI**.
